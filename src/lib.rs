//! `mash-up` is a Rust library that provides the dependencies for building web apps
//! using the MASH stack: Maud, Axum, SQLx, and HTMX. Instead of managing these
//! dependencies manually, you can simply include this crate in your project to
//! import all the necessary dependencies for web development.

pub fn placeholder() {
    // This is just a placeholder to make the crate compile.
